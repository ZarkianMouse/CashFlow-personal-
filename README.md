# CashFlow-personal-
Program based off the game published by the Rich Dad company.  Consists of a more randomized version of the "Rat Race" component

Hopefully this doesn't contradict any copyright laws.  I primarily made it so that my siblings and I could play a more interesting version of Cash Flow.
