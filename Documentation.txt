Card distribution:
The cards come in four varieties: Market, Doodad, and Big and Small Deals.
These cards were adapted from the original Cash Flow game in order to provide for a more interesting gameplay experience.

Market cards deal with fluctuations in the economy relating to real estate, business ventures, stocks, and other commodities.
Players can possess cards affected by the market through purchases made using Big and Small Deal cards.
Doodad cards relate to purchases made in daily life that affect overall financial wellbeing from as simple 
as a night out on the town with friends to graduation parties, weddings, and major house repairs.
